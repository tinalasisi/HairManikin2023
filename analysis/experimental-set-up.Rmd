## Introduction

In brief, the experiments were carried out in a climate controlled chamber at the University of Loughborough (UK) using a full-body thermal manikin with 20 independently controllable zones. Human hair wigs ranging from straight to tightly curled were used to test the effect of hair on heat gain/loss in a number of conditions.

The experimental variables were:
- head covering (no wig, straight wig, moderately curled wig, tightly curled wig)
- radiation (on vs. off)
- wind speed (0.3m/s, 1m/s, 2.5m/s)
- evaporation (manikin with dry scalp vs. manikin with wet scalp)

## Set-up
Dry heat resistance experiments were carried out from October to November 2018 in a climate controlled chamber with a custom-built wind tunnel (see below).


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/manikin-chamber-setup.jpeg", error = FALSE)

```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/manikin-chamber-setup-diagram.png", error = FALSE)

```


## Data

The raw data from the manikin is structured as follows

```{r}

raw_manikin <- read_csv(F("data/raw_manikin_output/round_1/HighCurv_RadOff_wind0_3 (run with new conditions).csv"), skip = 16) %>% 
  clean_names()

head(raw_manikin)

```

The data can be cleaned using the following pipeline.

```{r}

raw_manikin <- read_csv(F("data/raw_manikin_output/round_1/HighCurv_RadOff_wind0_3 (run with new conditions).csv"), skip = 16) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  select(c(x1, x2, contains("head"), ambient_71:ambient_74)) %>% 
  rename(time_elapsed = x1,
         time_hms = x2,
         surface_temp = head_4,
         heatflux = head_38,
         avg_amb= ambient_71,
         amb_1 = ambient_72,
         amb_2 = ambient_73,
         rh = ambient_74) %>% 
  slice(-(1:2)) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(across(!time_hms, as.numeric)) %>% 
  mutate(time_hms = hms(time_hms)) %>% 
  mutate(time_elapsed = dseconds(time_elapsed)) %>% 
  select(time_elapsed, time_hms, everything())
  

head(raw_manikin)

```
### Variables extracted
Since we are only interested in the head, all other zones have been dropped. The variables are as follows:

- `time_elapsed` (in seconds) describes how long the experiment has been running
- `surface_temp` (deg C) describes surface temperature for head zone
- `heatflux` (W/m2) describes heat loss in watts per meter square.
- `avg_amb` (deg C) describes average ambient temperature based on two measurements
- `amb_1` (deg C) first ambient temperature sensor
- `amb_2` (deg C) second ambient temperature sensor
- `rh` (percentage) describes relative humidity in the chamber.


```{r}

raw_manikin_long <- raw_manikin %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = surface_temp:rh, names_to = "var")


```

```{r}

raw_manikin_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time_elapsed, 
             y = value,
             col = var)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(var ~ ., scales = "free")

```

### Variables calculated
A stable period is then chosen to average.

Some information required for the calculations includes the Area of skin surface on the manikin (Ask), which is `0.0978` in meters squared.

```{r}

start_time_mins = 15
end_time_mins = 40
area = 0.0978

start_time = start_time_mins*60
end_time = end_time_mins*60

raw_manikin %>% 
  filter(time_elapsed > start_time & time_elapsed < end_time) %>% 
  summarise(across(!c(time_elapsed, time_hms), ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE))) %>% 
    mutate(heat_resistance = (surface_temp-avg_amb)/max(0.01, heatflux),
           clo = (heat_resistance/0.155))

```

Two additional variables are calculated: `heat_resistance` and `clo`. Both are measures of insulation. 

Heat resistance is calculated from the difference between the surface temperature and the ambient temperature

Other calculations

net solar influx (W/m2) is calculated as: 

$$heatflux_{(radiation)}- heatflux_{(no \ radiation)}$$

temperature correction for 4C (no radiation) is calculated as:

$$28/heat\ resistance_{(no \ radiation)} $$
temperature correction for 4C (radiation) is calculated as:

$$temp\ corrected \ heat loss_{(4C)} - solar\ influx $$

temperature correction for 30C (no radiation) is calculated as:

$$5/heat\ resistance_{(no \ radiation)} $$
temperature correction for 30C (radiation) is calculated as:

$$temp\ corrected \ heat loss_{(30C)} - solar\ influx $$
